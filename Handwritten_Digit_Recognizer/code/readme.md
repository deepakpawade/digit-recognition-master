##predict.py
This code is a GUI-based deep learning application for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The application loads a pre-trained model from a file named 'mnist1.h5' using the load_model function from the keras library.

The user can draw a digit on the canvas provided in the GUI and press the "Recognize" button to recognize the drawn digit. The drawn image is then pre-processed and passed to the loaded model for prediction. The prediction result is displayed in the label widget in the GUI. The "Clear" button can be used to clear the canvas.

The code also contains some utility functions such as get_handle, predict_digit, and preprocessing_image that are used in the main functionality of the application. The predict_digit function predicts the digit using the trained model, and the preprocessing_image function pre-processes the image before passing it to the model for prediction.

##train.py
This code is a Python script that trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits. The script loads the MNIST dataset from the Keras library and preprocesses the data by normalizing the pixel values. Then, it creates a sequential model using Keras and adds several convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and dense layers to it. Finally, the model is compiled with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adadelta optimizer. The model is then trained on the training data using the fit method and the trained model is saved to the disk with the filename "mnist.h5".

This script can be run locally on your computer with a Python environment that has the required libraries installed (Keras, TensorFlow, etc.). To host this bot, you can use a cloud-based platform like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure. These platforms allow you to easily upload and run your model on virtual machines, which eliminates the need to manage infrastructure yourself. You can also use platforms like Heroku to host your bot
